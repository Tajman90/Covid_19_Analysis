# Covid_19_Analysis
The project gives us an idea on the impact of Corona Virus globally in terms of confirmed cases, deaths reported, number of recoveries and active cases. It also shows how India was affected since the pandemic started. The main goal is to clean, process and visualize, the datasets for further use in analytics and research.
